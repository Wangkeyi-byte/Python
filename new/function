Def square(x):
    return x*x
for i in range(10):
    print(f"the square of {i} is {square(i)}")





assume you have a file "functions" that defines {square}
and then you have for i in range(10):
                        print(f"the square of {i} is {square(i)}")
you can import difinition from the first file,
from functions import square
and then you can have,
for i in range(10):
    print(f"the square of {i} is {square(i)}")
